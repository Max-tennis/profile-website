                    <p>I am competing in the junior international tour in tennis, aspiring to make it to the top 100 in the world and being a D1 US college player in the process. I have achieved multiple awards in the sport including getting runner-up in the 2023 Kiwi Indoor Doubles 14U, at current 2024 Auckland Doubles Champion, 2024 Waikato Doubles Champion, 2024 Canterbury Finalist in Doubles as well as multiple other regional titles. This year I have travelled to Melbourne at the Hume Tennis centre and played two senior tournaments where I lost in the semi-final and quarter-final. My philosophy in tennis  is to always remain positive even in tough times, keep it simple as all sports are, and never be afraid to make mistakes. Some of my strongest characteristics include, my mentality and the fact that I will never give up, stay hopeful and be determined in the face of any challenge. Another one of my characteristics is my work ethic which is why I try and complete my work to the highest standard.</p> <!-- This is a paragraph of Skills -->
